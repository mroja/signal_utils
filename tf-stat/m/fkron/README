A replacement fast mex routine for the kronecker product.
=========================================================

The routine fkron.c replaces the m-file kron.m.
It produces the kronecker product of matrices of any size, full or sparse.  

The call is 	

>>	C=fkron(A,B) 

The resulting matrix C is sparse if either of A or B is sparse.

This routine is somewhat faster than the m-file, especially if compiled
with a good optimizing compiler.

Installation
============

%	cmex -O3 CC=gcc fkron.c
	
Or your favorite combination of C compiler and optimizing options.

Then move the resulting file called fkron.{ext}, where {ext} depends
on your machine architecture, to a directory on your MATLABPATH.

Then, in MATLAB, try a simple test like 

>>	test_fkron		% from the supplied test_fkron.m

or a more comprehensive exercise like 

>>	bigtime_fkron(10,13)	% from the supplied bigtime_fkron.m

The latter will make sure the compiled code executes correctly and
will give you an estimate of the increase in speed you can expect,
as a factor of the matrix size and sparsity.

The author would like to receive your comments.
