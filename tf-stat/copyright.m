%   This file is part of the TFStats package for calculating significant
%   ERD/ERS in EEG data and similar paradigms. Software was written  
%   by Jaroslaw Zygierewicz, Hubert Klekowicz, Piotr Durka and Mariusz Beksa  
%   at the Department of Biomedical Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics, 
%   Warsaw University (http://brain.fuw.edu.pl).
%   Details of the procedures are given in the following papers (preprints available
%   from http://eeg.pl), which should be quoted in scientific publications using TFStats:
